### Tacit Collusion by Pricing Algorithm with Rule-Based Rivals

**Abstract**: Pricing algorithms, especially reinforcement learning algorithms, have been widely used in the past decades for firms in competitive markets, which are very helpful for firms to capture more information of the market and their rivals. Existing literature has shown that, however, reinforcement learning algorithms could lead to supracompetitive prices without any communication between firms. In a framework of price competition between two firms both starting with a rule-based algorithm, we show evidence that (1) if one firm is competing using a reinforcement learning algorithm with a rule-based rival, the price is always going to weakly increase, and (2) if both firms are adopting, the one that adopts later would benefit more, and supracompetitive prices are obtained but the price change is ambiguous compared to the initial case. Our findings contribute to the literature by highlighting the importance of the order of algorithm adoption and the transition from rule-based algorithm to reinforcement learning algorithm, which makes it possible to compare the result with previous steady state in a more general case.

### The Impact of Return Policies and Perception Heterogeneity on Sales Platforms for Experience Goods: An Experimental Study

with [Jinliang Liu](https://sites.google.com/view/jinliangliu),      Latest Draft: [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5112511)

**Abstract**: On sales platforms for experience goods, consumers only know the distribution of a good's value before purchase, while its actual value is revealed only after the purchase. However, consumers' perceptions of the distribution's range may vary, and the presence of a return policy can also influence the behavior of both sellers and buyers. Utilizing a post-price framework and controlled laboratory experiments, this paper provides the first investigation of experience goods markets that examines (1) the presence of a return policy and (2) the level of consumers' perception heterogeneity about the range of the value's corresponding distribution. We find that return policies lead to lower uniform prices in markets for experience goods. In addition, a larger perception heterogeneity reduces prices and increases return rates. Our results highlight potential downsides of return policies in online sales platforms.
